### access index elements    
The notation `list[i]` (list could be any types of variable and naming) is a common way across many programming languages to  access an element at a specific index i in a collection, whether that collection is a string, list, array, or even some other data structure that supports indexing.

### Two Pointers:
Single `i` in a loop: Locks you into comparing at the same index.
Two pointers: Allows independent movement of the pointers, move freely base on whatever condition.
